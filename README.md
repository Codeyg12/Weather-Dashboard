# Weather Dashboard
The goal of this project is to make a weather dashboard using the OpenWeatherMap API. I foun dthis project to be slightly difficult but the entire process was great. I feel like I didn't work as fast as I'd hoped but learning everything and going through all the different features was awesome. I look forward to continuing work with APIs.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. When looking up a city both the current conditions and the 5 day forecast show up
2. The weather conditions include city name, date, weather icon, temperature, humidity, wind speed and the UVI 
3. When viewing the UVI it is clearly color coded
4. When viewing future forecasts it displays the date, a weather icon, temperature, wind speed and humidity
5. When I click on a previous searched city the results reappear

## Overall
I'm very excited to dive further into APIs and all the potential features. For this project my biggest help was going back and rewatching a few classes. That coupled with looking back over the mini project I was able to get most things without googling or stackoverflow. I did need help with the generating the cities in new lines instead of stacking as well as the clicking on past cities to show their results again.
